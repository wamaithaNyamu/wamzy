The field of artificial intelligence has really grown and it is increasingly difficult to keep up with every
algorithm that come up. The intention on this post is to post all algorithms I can find and learn as many of them as
I can. Not just learn how to use a library to do this but go the extra mile to understand the math and logic behind
them.
